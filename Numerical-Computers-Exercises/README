This repository contains exercises developed during the Numerical Computers course, focusing on low-level programming and digital design.

Contents:
- Verilog – digital circuit design (counters, multiplexers, FSMs, etc.)
- MIPS Assembly – low-level algorithms (arithmetic operations, loops, sorting, etc.)
